**`Machine Learning\Robotics\Learning`**

I am Daniel, originally from Poland, currently living in Israel. Started my engineering path by learning about robotics. During my M.Sc. 
I worked on robotic assembly tasks using Reinforcement Learning methods for agent training, this is when I got exposed to Machine Learning and I 
decided to go all in! Learned a lot during my studies, and continue to learn and work on projects in my free time.
Hope to bring value to the world via AI-based solutions.
